test 1 m=500 (only detected 3 mutations)\
test 2 flu data (did not work error in running screen shot 06-12 at 4:49)\
test 3,4,5 m=5000 (testing to see if we detect all 5 mutations) (yes it did)\
test 6 m=500m(did not detect all 5)\
test 7 m=10,000 (6 and 7 worked for alpha=.01)\
test 10= attempted H1N1 data set from GitHub (failed)\
test 19= simulation with postD=2, 3 tests\
test 20= simulation with postD=1, 3 tests\
test 102= simulation based on H3N2 reference genome with postD=1 (did not work until I changed postD to 4 but then it did not detect 5 mutations in test 1)\
test 103= simulation based on H3N2 reference genome with postD=3 \
test 104= simulation based on H3N2 ref genome with postD=3 and Pairs = c( "t1t2", "t1t3", "t2t3", "t1t3_D", "t2t3_D" ) (mutation at end) \
test 105= simulation based on H3N2 ref genome with postD=5 and Pairs = c( "t1t2", "t1t3", "t2t3" ) (mutation at end)\
